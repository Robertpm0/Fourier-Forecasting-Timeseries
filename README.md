# Fourier-Forecasting-Timeseries
Extracting key magnitudes from a time series using the fft for making out of sample forecasts

## To Do:

\- recompose key magnitudes for forecasting
\- Implement quantum algorithm for finding key frequencies
\- try on multiple indices
\- apply QFT and comapre results
